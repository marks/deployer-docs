The Domino Deployer is controlled via a CLI. The deployer is only a single command line application: `domino-deployment`.
This application, in turns, takes several subcommands, which are documented in this section.

> *Heads up!* By convention, most deploy engineers run this application from the root of the deployer directory, in which
> case the command would appear as `bin/domino-deployment` (so you might see documentation refer to this command this way)
